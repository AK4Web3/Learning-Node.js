# Learning-Node.js

### 1. Introduction to Node

- Understanding Node
  - As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.
  Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks
  - More about node is [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).
